# Problem Solving Practice

Welcome to the **Problem Solving Practice** repository! This repository is dedicated to improving problem-solving skills through hands-on practice with coding challenges and algorithm exercises. Here, you’ll find solutions, explanations, and tips to enhance your approach to programming problems.

## Repository Overview

This repository is organized by topics and difficulty levels. Each problem includes:
- Problem description
- Solution code
- Explanation of the solution
- Space and time complexity analysis (where applicable)
- Alternate approaches (if any)

## Problem Solving Tips

Here are some strategies to keep in mind while tackling problems:

### 1. **Understand the Problem**
   - Read the problem carefully, and make sure you understand what’s being asked.
   - Identify the input and output requirements.
   - Look for any constraints or edge cases that might affect your solution.

### 2. **Break Down the Problem**
   - Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
   - If the problem is complex, outline a step-by-step solution to get a clear path forward.

### 3. **Start with a Simple Example**
   - Begin with a small example or test case to validate your understanding.
   - Walk through your thought process with this example to check if your approach is sound.

### 4. **Optimize After Finding a Solution**
   - Focus on getting a working solution first, even if it’s not the most efficient.
   - Afterward, try to optimize your solution to improve its time and space complexity.
   - Think about possible improvements like reducing the number of loops or using more efficient data structures.

### 5. **Use Pseudocode or Comments**
   - Write pseudocode or comments to outline your approach before writing actual code.
   - This can help you structure your solution and identify any gaps in logic.

### 6. **Test and Debug Thoroughly**
   - Test your code with various cases, including edge cases and unexpected inputs.
   - Debug step-by-step if you encounter any issues to understand where your solution might be failing.

### 7. **Stay Persistent and Practice Regularly**
   - Problem-solving skills improve with regular practice.
   - Don't get discouraged if a solution isn’t obvious—break down the problem, analyze similar problems, and keep practicing.
